# o-bot

A Discord bot to only make sure 'o' is uttered. Inspired by https://github.com/vcokltfre/hbot-rewrite

## why?

I would tend to accidently write 'o' instead of 'oh' and eventually used 'o' more in chat <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/938030910174023710.png" width=20>

## Running the bot

1. Create a new environment variable in a .env file. Get the variable key names from [/src/private/env.d.ts](/src/private/env.d.ts).

2. Run the following command:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
